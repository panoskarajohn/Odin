### Front end project

I did not want to create with the with the .NET runtime. 
This is why it is not part of the solution. 

Front end project is a React app with Typescript and tailwind as its css design system.

To run the project, you need to install node.js and npm. 
Then you can run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

I am not a react developer so most of the code will probably be bad.

There is also a plan to create an admin app using blazor app.
So this solution folder will not be empty.
