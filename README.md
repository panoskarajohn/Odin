This is a repo with a lot of stolen code, maybe a bit modified.

Mostly from some repositories which I really like:

- https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers
- https://github.com/meysamhadeli/Airline-Microservices
- https://github.com/devmentors/Pacco

Inspired a lot from https://github.com/devmentors/
