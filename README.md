# Introduction

This is a playground, trying to become a decent solution. 
This is in progress, trying to put everything together. 

# Community:

This is a repo with a lot of stolen code, maybe a bit modified. 

Mostly from some repositories which I really like:

* https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers
* https://github.com/meysamhadeli/Airline-Microservices
* https://github.com/devmentors/Pacco

Inspired a lot from https://github.com/devmentors/

And since the name of the project is Odin. 
The below image is Vegvisir also known as the Viking compass. May this repo guide you üòÅ
